**Welcome to HELLSNAGS.**

You're getting this email because you subscribed to _5 Questions, 1 Answer_, a newsletter that has now been quiet for ... years.

I’ve come to accept that I won’t revive 5Q1A anytime soon.

But I do have this new trivia-themed newsletter, and this is a preview. You'll have to [subscribe to get more issues](https://buttondown.email/Hellsnags).

What’s the deal with HELLSNAGS? Each issue I take one card from the original Genus edition nof Trivial Pursuit, then research and annotate the questions and answers.

It's a cultural exploration of 40-year-old trivia.

Again, to keep getting HELLSNAGS after this, you must [sign up at Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/Hellsnags). Y’all signed up for one newsletter and I didn’t want to default opt you into a new one.

## Geography

**Q: What cities were joined by the _Flying Scotsman_?**

**A: London and Edinburgh**

Did I get this right? **No**

Confession: I was thrown way, way off by the italicized train name. I assumed _Flying Scotsman_ was a TV show or movie. TIL that italicizing the proper names of specific vehicles is not uncommon, though it’s not current practice in Chicago or AP. (Then again AP doesn’t italicize _anything_. Heathens.)

[The Flying Scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Scotsman_(train)) is a train service that’s been running since 1862 — though when it started it was called the Special Scotch Express. It was redubbed the Flying Scotsman in 1926.

(This opens up a trivia nerd argument that the question is flawed, since London and Edinburgh were _already joined_ before “Flying Scotsman” came on the scene. I would not argue about this on a quiz night, though, especially since it doesn’t make way for a better answer.)

[You can still take the Flying Scotsman today.](https://www.flyingscotsman.org.uk/) Edinburgh to London is about a 4-hour trip.

## Entertainment

**Q: Who lived at 343 Bratner, Fernwood?**

**A: Mary Hartman**

Did I get this right? **No**

Had I spent longer thinkning about this question, I might’ve remembered that “Fernwood” is where the TV show _Fernwood 2 Night_ was set, and that that show was a spinoff of _[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Hartman,_Mary_Hartman)_.

And who's the title character? _Mary Hartman_ (played by Louise Lasser).

While _MH,MH_ is a show I’ve heard of, I’ve never seen it, even though it’s the 38th greatest TV series of all time according to Matt Zoller Seitz and Alan Sepinwall’s indispensable [_TV: The Book_.](https://www.amazon.com/TV-Book-Experts-Greatest-American/dp/1455588199/)

As with much of ’70s television that has not been rebooted as a movie, I suspect this show has vanished from the cultural awareness of most people younger than, say, 50\. But [the DVD set](https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Hartman-Complete/dp/B00ESZZOM2) is available on Amazon!

## History

Q: Who was the only person convicted in the My Lai Massacre?

A: William Calley

Did I get this right? **No**

Should I have known this? Probably.

If I were writing a question about this historical info, I’d probably reverse it: “Second Lieutenant William Calley was the only person convicted for what war crime?” I›m sure Calley's name was somewhat better known a decade after the trial rather than almost 50 years later.

Wikipedia on the [Mỹ Lai Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre) and [William Calley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Calley).

## Arts & Literature

**Q: What Shakespearean play features a character named Puck?**

**A: _Midsummer Night’s Dream_**

Did I get this right? **Yes**

English degree. One of the more popular Shakespeare plays. A gimme for me, especially since I read The Sandman a bunch of times, and it features the play and Puck as recurring motifs.

(I also read _Alpha Flight_, but that’s a different Puck.)

It occurred to me that “Shakespearean” implies that it’s a play reminiscent of Shakespeare, but not actually by Shakespeare. Not sure why they went with the adjective instead of just “Shakespeare play.”

[Read the Wikipedia article!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream) Read [the full play!](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/midsummer/full.html)

## Science & Nature

**Q: What’s a. m. an abbreviation for, as in 10 a. m.?**

**A: _[Ante meridiem](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ante%20meridiem)_**

Did I get this right? **Yes**

The trickiest part of this question would be not accidentally saying “antemeridian,” which also means “before noon” but is not the phrase being abbreviated.

## Sports & Leisure

**Q: Who succeeded Avery Brundage as International Olympic Committee chairman?**

**A: Lord Killanin**

Did I get this right? Ha ha ha ha **no**

I could not tell you the _current_ IOC chairman, much less the IOC chairman who retired when I was 10.  

Granted, sports are … not my category, but I’d be interested in knowing how many people these days know who [Brundage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Brundage) or [Lord Killanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Morris,_3rd_Baron_Killanin) were.

Learned from Wikipedia that they did not directly succeed each other —there was a several-year gap between Brundage and Killanin, and a couple-year gap between Killanin and Juan Antonio Samaranch.

Killanin was president from shortly after the Munich games through the 1980 games in Moscow. He did not believe the Olympics shoud be involved in politics. From his [_New York Times_ obituary](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/26/sports/lord-killanin-olympic-leader-dies-at-84.html):

> As I.O.C. president, Lord Killanin sought to eliminate national uniforms, flags and anthems, believing that nations would turn from propaganda if they were denied patriotic symbols. “We have the big shots, America and Russia, trying to prove their way of life is better because of the number of medals they win,” he said at the Munich Games. “It proves nothing of the sort.”
